## General info

The repository contains files and information obtained from java Basic course. This course introduce us to the java Basic and the java language for coding for example, Arrays, Casting, DoWhileLoop, Whileloop, Functions, If statements, switch statements, increments, Decrements, Logic and mathematic operations.
I learned how to declare variables, operators and methods.

### commands that i learned
|  Command | Function  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  System out print | print any information requeried |
|  String/Int | creates variables for text or numbers |
|  byte, short, int and long | integer numbers |
|  float and double | for decimal numbers |
|  char | for text |
|  boolean | for logical data |
|  math.ceil | rounds up |
|  math.floor | rounds down |
|  math.pow | elevates one number to another |
|  math.max | choose the bigger number |
|  math-sqrt | gives you the square root |
|  if/else | sentence that can be one or another and deppends of which sentence is correct is the code will run |
|  switch | Select a sentence of code between different cases |
|  static | Is used when main share data |
|  do/while | brings statements and then enters a condition and depending on the result, it loops until it becomes false. |
|  scanner sc | for have an answer in the program |
|  fori and foreach | fori breakes loops and foreach there is no index control and the collection is defined and it iterates 1 to 1 assigning the element |
|  return, continue and break data | sentence that determinates the end of the loop or the state of the data |
