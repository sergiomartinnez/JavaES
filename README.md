## General info
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this course i learned more about java and the focus in Object-Oriented Programming in language java, in the files of the repository you will find files like Doctor, appintments, patient, user, etc because the example of the code was an interface that the patient can book and appointment with the doctor, setting the date and the hour, check the previous booked appointments and the doctor can set their availabe appointments and set the hour too. It was separated in different files for modularity and better structure of the code.
=======
The repository contains files and information obtained from java Basic course. This course introduce us to the java Basic and the java language for coding for example, Arrays, Casting, DoWhileLoop, Whileloop, Functions, If statements, switch statements, increments, Decrements, Logic and mathematic operations.
I learned how to declare variables, operators and methods.

here is the detailed topics that i learned:
>- what is UML 
>- what is an object
>- properties and behaviors
>- classes and abstraction
>- modularity and the advantage of using it
>- constructor method and accesing to them
>- static methods
>- final for constants
>- overload constructors
>- heap and stack different memories 
>- encapsulate data
>- wrappers for making primitive data into objects
>- nested class and static class
>- enumerations for constant colections
>- dont repeat yourself
>- inheritance
>- polimorfism (overwrite a method)
>- interfaces
>- collections (set, list, hashset, treeset and arraylist) for store different data
>- map represents a mapping data structure
>- abstract classes for solving interfaces problems
>- anonymous classes instantiate an abstract class

------------
### the commands that i learned
declare and instantiate an object: doctor myDoctor = new doctor();
|  Command | Function  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| static | for global scope |
| import | import files |
| final | declare a constant |
| this. | specifies the variables used within a method |
| public, protected, default and private | levels of visibility |
| getters and setters | allow read and write the variables of the methods |
| wrappers ( byte, short, int, long, float...) | disguises primitive data to be objects |
| enum | declare a constant and written in Caps |
| extends | inheritance |
| super and this | super brings the methods of father class and this overload |
| @override | it helps to know that this method is not of the class |
| I | for implements and able for adding behaviors |
| equals | for == objects |
| scanner | for the user enter an answer|
| simple dateformat | for format dates and work with them |
=======

>- the method main and it is the point of enter in java application
>- versions of java and JDK
>- what is a variable and how to set variables
>- the code is sensitive to caps and lowercases
>- the variables start with letter, $ or _
>- the constants are written in capital and has _
>- the lower camel case and upper camel case for variables and methods, and upper for classes 
>- jShell
>- assignment, increment and decrement operators
>- math commands for addition subtraction division multiplication and percentage
>- cast: for changing the data that the program gives you
>- jar files
>- if/else conditions
>- switch for multiple choices 
>- Scope of variables
>- Equity, relational and logical operators
>- functions
>- how to set comments in code and javadoc (tags)
>- while
>- arrays

------------
### commands that i learned
|  Command | Function  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  System out print | print any information requeried |
|  String/Int | creates variables for text or numbers |
|  byte, short, int and long | integer numbers |
|  float and double | for decimal numbers |
|  char | for text |
|  boolean | for logical data |
|  math.ceil | rounds up |
|  math.floor | rounds down |
|  math.pow | elevates one number to another |
|  math.max | choose the bigger number |
|  math-sqrt | gives you the square root |
|  if/else | sentence that can be one or another and deppends of which sentence is correct is the code will run |
|  switch | Select a sentence of code between different cases |
|  static | Is used when main share data |
|  do/while | brings statements and then enters a condition and depending on the result, it loops until it becomes false. |
|  scanner sc | for have an answer in the program |
|  fori and foreach | fori breakes loops and foreach there is no index control and the collection is defined and it iterates 1 to 1 assigning the element |
|  return, continue and break data | sentence that determinates the end of the loop or the state of the data |
