#Example of Java OOP 
in this course i learned:
>- what is UML 
>- what is an object
>- properties and behaviors
>- classes and abstraction
>- modularity and the advantage of using it
>- constructor method and accesing to them
>- static methods
>- final for constants
>- overload constructors
>- heap and stack different memories 
>- encapsulate data
>- wrappers for making primitive data into objects
>- nested class and static class
>- enumerations for constant colections
>- dont repeat yourself
>- inheritance
>- polimorfism (overwrite a method)
>- interfaces
>- collections (set, list, hashset, treeset and arraylist) for store different data
>- map represents a mapping data structure
>- abstract classes for solving interfaces problems
>- anonymous classes instantiate an abstract class

the commands that i learned:
>- declare and instantiate an object: doctor myDoctor = new doctor();
>- static (for global scope)
>- import
>- final
>- this. for variables
>- public, protected, default and private 
>- getters and setters allow read and write the variables of the methods
>- wrappers ( byte, short, int, long, float...)
>- enum 
>- extends for inheritance
>- super and this (super brings the methods of father class and this overload)
>- @override it helps to know that this method is not of the class
>- I for implements and able for adding behaviors
>- equals for == objects
>- scanner for the user enter an answer
>- simple dateformat for format dates and work with them

the example of the code was an interface that the patient can book and appointment with the doctor, setting the date and the hour, check the previous booked appointments and
the doctor can set their availabe appointments and set the hour too. It was separated in different files for modularity and better structure of the code.
